Between seasons, player power resets but identity and progression persist.

Post‑alpha: between‑season progression is not implemented in Alpha.

Persistent progression includes:

Account level based on lifetime participation

Cosmetic unlocks such as avatars, frames, and themes

Titles earned from previous seasons

Badge collections

Season history records

Post‑alpha persistent meta currency (Beta):

Persists across seasons
Cosmetic / identity use only
Cannot be traded
Cannot convert into Coins or Stars
Cannot affect competitive power

Optional influence / reputation metric (Post‑Release):

Non‑spendable
Eligibility / visibility modifier only
Never convertible
Not required for Beta

Account level:

Increases based on participation, not leaderboard rank.

Grants cosmetic unlocks and profile recognition only.

Collections:

Players collect cosmetics, badges, and titles across seasons.

Collections are visible on player profiles.

Season history:

Each completed season is recorded in the player profile.

History includes season number, final rank tier, earned rewards, and notable trade activity counts.

Return incentives:

Players returning after missing a season may earn a small cosmetic bonus.

Return incentives never grant coins or stars.

No currency may ever convert into Coins or Stars, directly or indirectly.

Season variety:

Each season may include a simple modifier that affects presentation or cosmetic rewards.

Core economy rules remain unchanged.

Between-season progression is designed to reward long-term engagement without creating power creep.
