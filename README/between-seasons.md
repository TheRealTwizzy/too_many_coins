Between seasons, player power resets but identity and progression persist.

Persistent progression includes:

Account level based on lifetime participation

Cosmetic unlocks such as avatars, frames, and themes

Titles earned from previous seasons

Badge collections

Season history records

Account level:

Increases based on participation, not leaderboard rank.

Grants cosmetic unlocks and profile recognition only.

Collections:

Players collect cosmetics, badges, and titles across seasons.

Collections are visible on player profiles.

Season history:

Each completed season is recorded in the player profile.

History includes season number, final rank tier, and earned rewards.

Return incentives:

Players returning after missing a season may earn a small cosmetic bonus.

Return incentives never grant coins or stars.

Season variety:

Each season may include a simple modifier that affects presentation or cosmetic rewards.

Core economy rules remain unchanged.

Between-season progression is designed to reward long-term engagement without creating power creep.
