At the end of a season, the economy is frozen and final standings are recorded.

End-of-season resolution:

Star purchases and coin earning are disabled once the season ends.
Brokered trading is disabled once the season ends; any pending offers are canceled safely.

Final star balances determine leaderboard rankings.

Rankings are snapshotted and stored permanently.

Rewards (post‑alpha):

Players earn persistent rewards based on season participation and performance.

Rewards are cosmetic or status-based only and do not grant economic advantage.

Rewards may include a persistent meta currency (post‑alpha) for cosmetic / identity use only; it cannot be traded, cannot convert into Coins or Stars, and cannot affect competitive power.

Optional influence / reputation (post‑release) is non‑spendable, eligibility/visibility‑only, and never convertible.

No currency may ever convert into Coins or Stars, directly or indirectly.

Reward types include:

Season badges for participation

Titles for leaderboard tiers

Endgame achievement badges

Profile history entries showing season rank and stats

Late-season recognition (post‑alpha):

Players who participate during the final week earn additional recognition.

Completing late-season challenges grants exclusive cosmetic rewards.

Season closure (post‑alpha):

A summary screen shows final rank, earned rewards, and season highlights.

Players are encouraged to join another active season or the next upcoming season.

All rewards are granted automatically and recorded server-side (post‑alpha).
