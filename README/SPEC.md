Game: Too Many Coins! (MMO web)

Seasons: 28 days

Concurrent seasons: max 4, start dates staggered 7 days

Join rules: players can join any active season anytime

Core loop: earn coins (faucets) -> buy stars (system store) -> leaderboard rank

No player-to-player trading

Bulk buy allowed but price scales so hard it’s almost infeasible late-season

Inflation model: server-emitted coin pool, time-sliced, global daily budget decreases over season

Late-season: star prices higher, coin supply lower

Anti-abuse: 1 active account per IP per season by default; whitelist request + wave approvals

Rewards: cosmetics/titles/badges persist between seasons; coins/stars reset per season

Real-time: prices and season stats update via SSE or WebSockets

Server-authoritative economy: all pricing, caps, purchases enforced server-side
