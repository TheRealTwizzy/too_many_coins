Players earn coins through a limited set of server-controlled faucets.

Daily Login:

Available once per 20 hours per season.

Grants a small, fixed amount of coins.

Designed to reward consistency, not grinding.

Daily Tasks:

A small set of simple tasks refreshed at daily reset.

Tasks grant moderate coin rewards.

Completing all tasks does not exceed the player daily earning cap.

Active Play:

Coins are granted at a slow, steady rate during active participation.

Active play rewards are capped per hour and per day.

AFK or idle behavior does not generate coins.

Comeback Reward:

Available only to players who have been inactive for a defined period.

Grants a one-time, modest coin boost.

Cannot exceed a fixed percentage of the daily earning cap.

Caps:

Each player has a daily coin earning cap per season.

The cap decreases as the season progresses.

Late-season caps are significantly lower than early-season caps.

All faucet grants draw from the global emission pool.
If the pool is low, faucet rewards are proportionally throttled.

All faucet usage and coin grants are validated server-side and logged.
