Coins enter the game only through a server-controlled emission system.

Each season has a global coin emission pool that refills continuously over time.

For each season day:

A maximum global coin budget is defined.

This budget is released gradually across 24 hours.

Coin emission occurs on fixed server ticks.

At each tick:

A small portion of the daily coin budget becomes available.

Available coins are added to the emission pool.

Players earn coins by drawing from this pool via allowed faucets.

Coin faucets include:

Daily login rewards

Daily tasks

Capped active play rewards

Limited comeback rewards

Each player has a per-day earning cap.

The cap decreases as the season progresses.

Late-season caps are significantly lower.

If the emission pool is low:

Coin earning rates are automatically throttled.

Faucets slow down rather than shutting off abruptly.

Coins are never created directly by player actions.
Coins cannot exceed the remaining global budget for the day.

All coin grants are validated server-side and recorded in an append-only log.
