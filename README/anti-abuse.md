The system must actively prevent and mitigate abuse and coordinated manipulation.

Access controls:

Only one active player per IP address per season is allowed by default.

Additional accounts from the same IP are blocked from joining a season unless whitelisted.

Whitelist system:

Players may submit a whitelist request for shared networks.

Requests are reviewed and approved or denied in periodic waves.

Whitelist approval applies per IP group, not per account.

Account protections:

Account creation is rate-limited.

CAPTCHA and verification are required.

New accounts must wait a short cooldown period before joining a season.

Throttles:

Per-player star purchase rate limits exist.

Per-IP star purchase limits exist, especially early in the season.

Coin earning and star buying may be dynamically throttled for suspicious activity.

Detection:

The system monitors for clustering patterns such as many new accounts from related IP ranges acting similarly.

Suspicious activity generates abuse events.

Abuse events may trigger automatic temporary throttles.

Enforcement:

Throttles are gradual and reversible.

The goal is to make abuse economically ineffective, not to punish publicly.

All abuse decisions and throttles are enforced server-side.
