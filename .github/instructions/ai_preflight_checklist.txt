SCOPE & INTENT

 I can state the change in one sentence (STEP INTENT).

 The change is foundational, not cosmetic.

 This prompt represents exactly one logical unit.

 I am not asking Codex to “also” do anything else.

If scope expands → STOP.

CANON & AUTHORITY

 I have reviewed AI_CONSTITUTION.txt.

 This change does not violate any immutable systems.

 If touching a protected mutable system (Time, Economy), it is explicitly named as the primary goal.

 Canon documentation (README/TODO) allows this change at the current phase.

If canon conflicts → STOP.

FILE BOUNDARIES

 I have an explicit FILES AFFECTED list.

 No file outside this list may be edited.

 Multiple systems are not mixed in this prompt.

If file scope is unclear → STOP.

SCHEMA DISCIPLINE (if applicable)

 Schema changes are additive only.

 No drops, renames, or semantic reinterpretation.

 Old code can run on the new schema.

 New code may assume the new schema exists.

If any answer is “maybe” → STOP.

RUNTIME SAFETY

 I know whether a server restart is required.

 Admin bootstrap invariants are confirmed unaffected.

 No retroactive state changes are implied.

 All effects are prospective only.

If startup behavior is uncertain → STOP.

TELEMETRY & AUDITABILITY

 All meaningful changes are logged or observable.

 No silent behavior changes.

 Append-only logs remain append-only.

 Past seasons/data remain immutable.

If history can be altered → STOP.

CODEX CONSTRAINTS

 Prompt includes:

STEP INTENT

FILES AFFECTED

CHANGE DESCRIPTION

STARTUP SAFETY CHECK

STOP & COMMIT POINT

 Codex is not being asked to design policy.

 Codex is executing a predefined contract.

If Codex is deciding “what to do” → STOP.

COMMIT READINESS

 I will only commit if:

Code compiles

Behavior matches canon

Docs/TODO reflect reality

No known contradictions remain

 I understand that a commit is a confidence marker, not progress.

If not commit-ready → STOP.
